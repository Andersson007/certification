# Collection certification onboarding

This repository aims to provide a clear set of instructions and content to help Red Hat partners

- onboard their collections as certified content on Ansible Automation Hub
- reduce the probability of a collection version upload rejection

## Contributing to this repository

There are a lot of good things we could recommend partners to do to improve the quality of their collections,
but let's deliberately limit this repository's content to only what is **required**.

## Process

This section is a work in progress. We plan to elaborate on each point, add more details, and refine the content.

- [ ] The collection passes Galaxy-importer checks: link to the workflow
- [ ] Check naming conventions: link
- [ ] Check versioning strategy: link
- [ ] Changelog: explain options
- [ ] OSI license: link
- [ ] Ensure the `requires_ansible` compatibility: explain
- [ ] Dependencies requirements: requirements.txt, bindep.txt, collection dependencies
- [ ] README template: support and other sections

## Optional

- [ ] Refer to GH Actions for units and integration tests as a recommendation
- [ ] Refer to Community Standards (i.e. collection requirements) as a recommendation
